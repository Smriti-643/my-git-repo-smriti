In my "Face Emotion Detection using AI" project, I used machine learning and image processing to develop a system that detects emotions from facial expressions. I applied OpenCV for face detection and preprocessing, ensuring the images were optimized for model training.

Using TensorFlow and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), I trained the model on a labeled dataset of emotions like happiness, sadness, and anger. I fine-tuned parameters and used data augmentation to improve accuracy across different lighting conditions and facial angles.

To evaluate performance, I tested the model on a validation set and refined it based on accuracy and precision metrics. This project enhanced my understanding of AI, image processing, and deep learning, leading to a reliable emotion detection system.
